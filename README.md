# ThreadPool Task Scheduler

A high-performance, multi-threaded task scheduler implementation in C that demonstrates advanced concurrent programming concepts.

## Overview

This project implements a thread pool-based task scheduler that efficiently manages and executes multiple tasks concurrently using worker threads. It's designed as a learning resource for advanced C programming, multi-threading, and synchronization techniques.

## Features

- **Thread Pool Management**: Configurable number of worker threads
- **Thread-Safe Task Queue**: Mutex-protected task queue with condition variables
- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: Runtime task submission and execution
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination of worker threads
- **Memory Safety**: Proper allocation and deallocation of resources
- **Synchronization**: Advanced use of mutexes and condition variables
